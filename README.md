FajrFood

FajrFood is a specialized food delivery and logistics ecosystem built with Django, specifically engineered for Marawi City. As the first platform of its kind in the region, FajrFood bridges the gap between local culinary heritage and modern digital convenience.

The Mission
Marawi remains a significant urban center that has yet to be integrated into the global digital delivery landscape. FajrFood is designed to serve as the technological backbone for the city’s commerce, providing local vendors with the tools to reach customers and offering residents a reliable, streamlined ordering experience for the first time.

Project Status: MVP Ready
The platform has successfully reached its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) milestone. The core infrastructure is stable, secure, and ready for operational stress testing. Key features currently implemented include:

Vendor Management: Secure dashboards for local businesses to manage menus, pricing, and orders.

Order Orchestration: A robust backend to handle real-time tracking and logistics via Django.

Localized UX: A user interface optimized for the specific geographical and cultural context of Marawi.

2026 Roadmap
We are currently in the pre-deployment phase, focusing on operational scaling, local rider networking, and regulatory alignment.

Q1-Q2 2026: Final beta testing and local rider onboarding.

Q3 2026: Official deployment and shipment across Marawi City.

Q4 2026: Expansion of logistics services beyond food delivery into general parcel services.

Investment & Partnership
FajrFood is actively seeking investors and strategic partners to facilitate our 2026 launch. We are looking for contributors who are interested in:

First-mover advantage in a high-potential, untapped urban market.

Social impact through the digital transformation of local economies.

Scalable tech, utilizing a professional Python/Django stack designed for growth.
