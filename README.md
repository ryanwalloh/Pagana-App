Pagana-App
Pagana is a specialized food delivery and logistics ecosystem built with Django, engineered specifically for Marawi City. Inspired by the Meranao tradition of Pagana, the highest form of hospitality, our platform bridges the gap between local culinary heritage and modern digital convenience.

The Mission
Marawi is a vibrant urban center that has remained underserved by the global digital delivery landscape. Pagana is designed to serve as the technological backbone for the city’s commerce, providing local vendors with the tools to reach customers and offering residents a reliable, streamlined ordering experience rooted in the spirit of service.

Project Status: MVP Ready
The platform has successfully reached its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) milestone. The architecture is stable, secure, and ready for localized operational testing. Key features include:

Vendor Management: Secure dashboards for local businesses to manage menus, traditional pricing, and digital orders.

Order Orchestration: A robust Django based backend designed to handle real-time tracking and logistics in the local geographical context.

Cultural Integration: A user interface that respects and highlights Marawi's unique identity and commerce patterns.

2026 Roadmap
We are currently in the pre-deployment phase, focusing on operational scaling and establishing a local logistics network.

Q1 to Q2 2026: Final beta testing and local rider and partner onboarding.

Q3 2026: Official deployment and shipment across Marawi City.

Q4 2026: Expansion of services to include broader community driven logistics and parcel delivery.

Investment and Partnership
Pagana is actively seeking investors and strategic partners to facilitate our 2026 launch. We offer:

First Mover Advantage: Entry into a high potential, untapped urban market with zero existing delivery competition.

Social Impact: A mission-driven approach to digitalize the local economy and create sustainable employment.

Modern Tech Stack: A professional, scalable Python and Django infrastructure designed for rapid growth.
